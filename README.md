# Cloud-Computing-Tools
This repository is a set of tools implemented in C++ and python, which enables quick calculations for various cloud computing problems. There are executable files for each C++ program as well python classes for each algorithm. This is a work in progress but so far, the tools available are:
1. Mean Time to Failure Calculator
2. Power Usage Effectiveness Calculator
3. Finger Table Generator
